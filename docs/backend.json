    "reasoning": "The data structure focuses on storing contact form submissions securely. Since the contact form submissions do not require user-specific access control and are managed by the NGO SABAL, they are stored in a root-level collection called `contactFormSubmissions`. This simplifies security rules and data retrieval. Authorization Independence is achieved as there are no hierarchical dependencies. The QAP is achieved because all documents within the collection share the same security requirements, namely, only authorized personnel (e.g., SABAL staff, defined via a global role) can read/write."

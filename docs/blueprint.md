## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Earthy orange (#D2691E), to convey energy without high saturation, ensuring a welcoming and calming aesthetic.
- Background color: Very light orange (#FAF0E6) provides a soft backdrop that keeps the focus on the content, and gives plenty of contrast against the orange.
- Accent color: Muted reddish orange (#BC8F8F), positioned to the left on the color wheel, which enlivens calls to action.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif that balances a contemporary look with warmth, and works equally well for headings and body.
- Employ clean, modern icons representing SABAL's focus areas (health, community, etc.).
- Design a clean, multi-page layout with a focus on readability and engagement.
- Incorporate subtle animations and transitions to enhance user experience.
